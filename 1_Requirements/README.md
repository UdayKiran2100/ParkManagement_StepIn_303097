# INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this project is to make the token generation at parks ticket counter and the population and time limit tracking of the individuals inside the park.

# Research
Almost all park ticket counters prefer physical handling of tokens to users and billing at the counter.
But this project digitises the traditional method and adds some exciting features to it.
In the traditional Park ticket Counters , the Ticket manager bills each ticket and gives a token number by physical paper format.

This approach has been modified in this poject and the token number are digitally generated by the System. Also the tickteer only needs to enter the name of the customer and a token number will be assigned to him/her. The time at which the registration takes place will also be monitored so that as soon as the total time spent by the customer in the park exceeds the given time limit he or she will be notified to exit the park.
This helps in proper population management of the park to and prevents overcrowding.

## Benefits
The Park Management System provides wide range of benefit they are as follows:
-> Time Tracker
-> Token generation
-> Population Management

# Testing
Software testing is a critical element of software quality assurance and represents the ultimate review of specification, design and code generation. The increasing visibility of software as a system element and the attendant “cost” associated with a software failure are motivating force for well planned, through testing.

All the functions are tested against various test cases for Unit Testing.

# 4 W's and 1 H
## Who:
Park Ticket Counter Manager
## What:
It generates the unique digital tokens for Customers and Manages population of the park by tracking the time spent by the customers. 
## When:
During the open hours of the parks the application will be constantly in use.
## Where:
This application will be used at the park's ticket counters.
## How:
The application is written in C and no extra dependencies are required on the clients' systems. It uses various functions to store and generate tokeens and also track the time spent in the park. It also stores the current population.
